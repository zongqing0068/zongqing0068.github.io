Welcome to my homepage! :D ðŸ¥³

About me
------
I am a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). Prior to my postgraduate studies, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology \(Shenzhen\)](http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/) in 2024.


Research Interest
------
Iâ€™m mainly interested in the research of Natural Language Processing.



**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
