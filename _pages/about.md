Welcome to my homepage! :D ü•Ç

About me üë©‚Äçüéì
------
I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). Prior to my postgraduate studies, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Harbin Institute of Technology \(Shenzhen\)](http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/) in 2024. During my undergraduate study, I did research under the guidance of [Prof. Baotian Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5NiJ1VoAAAAJ).


Research Interest üí°
------
I‚Äôm mainly interested in the research of Natural Language Processing.

- Long Tail Knowledge
- Uncertainty Estimation
- Conceptual Reasoning
- Multimodal Learning
